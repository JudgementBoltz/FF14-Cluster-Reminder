# FF14-Cluster-Reminder
Quick little experiment with Javascript/Keeps FF14 Eorzea time and notifies me when unspoiled cluster nodes spawn
Eorzea clock generator obtained from http://jsfiddle.net/jryansc/6r85j/

##Work in progress##
Open in FireFox. This program allows me to surf the web while waiting for unspoiled node 
spawn timers in FF14. It will generate alerts to notify when spawn timers are up so I can tab
back into the game and farm up clusters.

Hoping to put speech audio alert notifiers in next commit.
